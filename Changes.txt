Changes compared to 1.7.10

- Hexorium Crystal items now glow both in hand and when dropped in the world.
- Energized Hexorium textured blocks now properly drop particles when broken/hit.
- Hexorium Crystal Block now orients similar to the Vanilla logs. It will orient to the side of the block it is clicked on when placing.
- Hexorium reinforcer is longer consumed in creative mode.
- Hexorium monoliths now have a breaking effect when their support is destroyed.
- All ores now drop xp.
- All ores now use vanilla (and resource pack) textures as their base.
- Doors are now placed like vanilla doors meaning the side of the clicked block decides the hinge position.
- Opening double doors has been improved. The effect is smoother, doesn't work if both doors aren't in the same state or with non-connected doors, isn't triggered by redstone.
- Different colors of glowing hexorium glass no longer obstruct (cull) each other
- Hexorium Ore and monoliths now drop the same amount of xp as gems (without fortune)
- All generation can now be configured separately for each dimension
- WIP: Hexorium Ore, Nether Ore, Monoliths and Nether Monoliths will now correctly follow their respective base texture (Stone and Netherrack). If the textures are changed using the texture packs, they will accordingly update as well.
- WIP: Hexorium Monoliths and Nether Monoliths now have a new and improved 3D model.
